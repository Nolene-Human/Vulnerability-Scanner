    In this section you will the basic knowledge to confidently manage your own home network or communicate with technical support on this matter.

    Why would ANYONE want to attack you?

    Easy, because they can, for your data or for the data you have access to.

    ** Do the test to see how and why the attackers could use you ** 
    
    What is a Network and Why Should I care? 
    
    You are connecting to the internet via a * DEVICE * through a * PORT *.
    The DEVICE connecting you to the internet is your WIFI ROUTER
    The Port is like a DOOR to and from the Internet World.
    Your Wifi Router is also commonly refered to as your * GATEWAY *.
    Each device will have a DOOR -> connected to your GATEWAY -> leading to the World Wide Web and all the hackers that live there.


    Your Gateway will assign each device on your network an address to identify and communicate with, this is called an * IP ADDRESS *
    Each device will have a unique * IP ADDRESS * and a * MAC ADDRESS *
    The router assign a devices and IP address and a Manufactureer assigns the Mac Address 


    Through these unique numbers we can identify the devices on your network (inlcuding its known vulnerabilites and uses). 

    This collective group of devices are called your * NETWORK *.

    Hackers can without your consent, connect, communicate or monitor your * NETWORK * 
    
    Once in your network, they can disguise themselves, reroute your internet activities to their servers in turn see your activities. This will include accounts, usernamesand password.
    
    These malicious activities are called *CYBER THREATS*.

    This is why you need to monitoring your Network.

    This tool will help you take the basic necessary precautions to avoid the most common *CYBER ATTACKS* by scanning your internal network for vulnerabilities and providing tips and learning pages to help you protect 
    your network.
