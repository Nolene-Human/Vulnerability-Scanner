    Top 10 Cybersecurity threats according to Embroker :

    1. Social Engineering: this relies on you making a mistake by giving away your information (phishing and email impersonation)
    2. Third-party Exprosure : Those outside of a protected network, work from home, contractors.
    3. Configuration Mistakes : Although this relates mostly to Technical Professionals not having anything is a mistake.
    4. Poor Cyber Hygiene : Poor password, unprotected home networks.
    5. Cloud Vulnerabilities : Web Application Breaches, Cloud Services
    6. Mobile Device Vulnerabilities : Malicious mobile application
    7. Internet of Things : Access points for attackers due their low cybersecurity defences
    8. Ransomeware : Through malicious software hold systems access for ransom
    9. Poor Data Management : Exploiting your information
    10.Inadequate Post-Attack Procedures : Not having a system or process in place to recover from any of these attacks
