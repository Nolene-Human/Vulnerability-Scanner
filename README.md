# Vulnerability_Scanner
## by Nolene Human 

This application is built of the back of a Bachelor of Software Engineering Cybersecurity assignment to investigate a solution with recomended improvements.

# Introduction
Since 2020 the working landscape has changed as more and more people are starting to work from home. This means that cyber threats and the proactive measures to prevent security breaches are no longer only a business networks issue, but also the responsibility of the employee and that of a contractor working on their private network. There are multiple solutions to secure connections between these networks, but due to the lack in the technical understanding and fear to adjust the their own network security are creating a huge risk. 

Therefor I am suggesting a simple first line of defence solutions to Protect User against the most common cyber threats.  A vulnerability scanner with a built in training tool designed for non-technical users together with easy to use instructions on how to secure the network.  

Must Have: Vulnerability scanner that will look for know threats on the most common issues faced by a Work from Home network environments. Simple and easy to understand. Recommendations on how to fix the know / identified risks. 

Should Have: Education tool for user on the best practises used to secure an environment. 

Could Have: Test and report on the current environment based on best practices. 

Won’t Have: Vulnerability Management tool
